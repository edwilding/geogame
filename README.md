A geoguessr inspired game, using individual's api keys.
[Play it here!](https://geogame.peakdistrictwalks.org.uk)

**What is this?**

This is a game that uses Geoguessr as inspiration.

**Why does this exist?**

Sadly, because of Google's predatory pricing strategy for their Maps api, geoguessr have had to modify their game in a detrimental way to cut costs.

I created this project to allow people to play the game how it used to be (or as close to it).

**What does the "Broken Streetview" button do?**

Sometimes a coordinate with no valid streetview is selected for you, you will just get a black screen.

If this occurs please click the "Broken Streetview" button and you will be provided with a new scene and the faulty coordinate will be removed from the database.
